# Quick Start
Run `start_tutorial.sh` to install [BioBlend](http://bioblend.readthedocs.org) in a virtualenv and start the [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).

# Installation
Go to a directory of you choice and clone this repository:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/ratzeni/bioblend-tutorial.git
```
Cd into the tutorial directory
```bash
$ cd bioblend-tutorial
```
Create a new virtual environment in folder `.venv`
```bash
$ virtualenv .venv
```
> [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) is a tool to create isolated Python environments. 
virtualenv creates a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the packages that a Python project would need.

To begin using the virtual environment, it needs to be activated:
```bash
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```
The name of the current virtual environment will now appear on the left of the prompt to let you know that itâ€™s active. 
From now on, any package that you install using pip will be placed in the my_project folder, isolated from the global Python installation.

Now, install bioblend
```bash
$ pip install bioblend
```
Install [jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
```bash
$ pip install jupyter
```
Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook:
```bash
$ jupyter notebook
```
> The [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)
is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, 
visualizations and explanatory text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, 
statistical modeling, machine learning and much more.

### Exiting
`Ctrl-c` to exit from notebook.     
When ou are done working in the virtual environment, you can deactivate it:
```bash
$ deactivate
```
